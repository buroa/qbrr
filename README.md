# qbrr

## Description

qbrr is a CLI tool for reannouncing torrents in qBittorrent with problematic trackers, written in Go using the [github.com/autobrr/go-qbittorrent](https://github.com/autobrr/go-qbittorrent) client.

## Why another reannouncer?

- **Tracker-friendly:** Unlike other tools that blindly reannounce torrents at fixed intervals, `qbrr` is *nice* to torrent trackers. It waits for the torrent to make its initial contact with the tracker and checks the status. Only if the tracker is problematic does `qbrr` perform a reannounce. This minimizes unnecessary tracker requests and helps avoid bans or rate-limiting.

- **Scalable concurrency:** `qbrr` uses Goâ€™s `sync.WaitGroup` to process multiple torrents concurrently. This means it can efficiently handle thousands of torrents at once, ensuring no announcements are missed even for large clients running in daemon mode.
